# Mult Agent System - Cat & Mouse

This project implements a multi-agent system consisting of three principal agents: Cat, Mouse, and Cheese. The objective of the system is to simulate a scenario where cats track mice, mice eat cheese, and mice can reproduce.

## Agents

### Cat
The cat agent's main role is to track and catch mice. It uses various strategies and algorithms to locate and pursue mice within the system.

### Mouse
The mouse agent's primary objective is to find and eat cheese. When a mouse successfully consumes cheese, it grows in size. However, if a mouse is caught by a cat, it dies.

### Cheese
The cheese agent represents a food source for mice. Mice are attracted to cheese and will actively seek it out to consume it.

## Reproduction
Mice have the ability to reproduce within the system. This allows for the population of mice to grow over time, creating a dynamic and evolving environment.

## Usage
To run the multi-agent system, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries.
2. Configure the system parameters, such as the number of cats, mice, and cheese.
3. Run the simulation and observe the interactions between the agents.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional behaviors and strategies for the cat and mouse agents.
- Introduce obstacles and barriers within the system to add complexity to the simulation.
- Enhance the reproduction mechanism to incorporate genetic algorithms for evolving mouse behavior.
